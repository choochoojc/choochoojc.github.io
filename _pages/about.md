My name is Jocelyn (Ziming) Chen and I am a recent graduate of the Master of Science in Biostatistics program from the University of Toronto - Dalla Lana School of Public Health. I also hold a Bachelor's degree from the University of Toronto in Statistics and Actuarial Science, conferred in 2021.

Currently, I am a biostatistical analyst in [IMPaCT Lab](https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/heath/) at the Hospital for Sick Children, and my position involves novel Bayesian clinical trial designs.

I'm hosting a new podcast about biostatistics hoping to talk to experts and professionals with different backgrounds about the statistical methods used in health research and their experience. My goal is to provide a deeper understanding of the role that biostatistics plays in modern scientific research and explore how it is being used to solve problems in the field of biology and medicine. Feel free to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/choochoojczm) or [email](<mailto: jocelynczm@gmail.com>) with your topics and guests suggestions (even yourself!)!
